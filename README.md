# Reminders for installation
- Always remove the config.php file before uploading (unless it is a fresh install)
- Upload what is inside "debate"
- Remember to turn on hidden files if you want .htaccess to correctly upload.
- Make sure the version number is updated
  - Guide: Major version changes, 1.X.x, Minor, 1.x.X, New generation, 2.+
- PHP Version at least 7, output_buffering enabled in php.ini, PDO better be enabled or things just won't work
- Make sure .htaccess in root has the development info removed!
